Smart Parking System Overview:
         The Smart Parking System is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to optimize parking space management in urban areas. It integrates NodeMCU, IR sensors, servo motors, and Adafruit IO for real-time data transmission and automated gate management.

Key Features:
Real-Time Data Transmission: NodeMCU sends live updates of parking space status to Adafruit IO, accessible via a mobile app.
Automated Gate Management: IR sensors and servo motors automate entry and exit gates based on vehicle detection.
Cloud Integration: Adafruit IO stores and monitors parking data, enabling remote checking of availability and efficient space management.

         To scale this project to a large-scale implementationWe can integrate additional sensors and cameras for enhanced accuracy and utilize advanced data analytics for predictive maintenance and optimized space utilization. Partnering with city municipalities and parking facilities can further extend the system's reach and impact.
